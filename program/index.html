<h1>Our Program</h1>
<h2 id="overview-intro" class="anchorable">Intro</h2>
<p>
  There is a huge gap between academia and industry. We bridges the gap with through our well designed Bridge program. Our Bridge program transforms beginners into full-stack software developers. Through effort, community support, and training, we help beginners with little or no technical background reach a level of proficiency that allows them to get paid to continue learning on the job as full-stack software developers.
</p>
<p>
  Our 18-week curriculum  focuses on core computer subjects like Operating System, Database Management, Computer Networks, and Problem Solving by understanding algorithms and data structures to implement algorithms efficiently. We will also focus on  Ruby, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, common JavaScript libraries, SQL, HTML and CSS, as well as pair programming, agile methodology and test driven development which enables you to develop your own product or idea all by yourselves.
</p>

<p>
  We believe anyone can join us. We do not base our admissions decision on past academic performance or programming experience of students as long as they are passionate to write code and are willing to work hard and learn new things. We look for students who have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A desire to create meaningful  and useful projects to the world through code.</li>
  <li>An individual who is able to think analytically and creatively about problems.</li>
  <li>Alignment with our values, which include willingness to learn new things and a passion for working with others.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview-how-we-learn" class="anchorable">How you learn</h2>
<p>
  Bridge program is something more than just teaching how to code. We show you how to make your ideas into reality and have fun while doing it!
</p>
<p>
  Our mentoring is on individual-to-individual basis not to the group of students. If you are very good in one area but need extra help in other, we will support according to your needs.
</p>
<p>
  Our emphasis is primarily on the practical skills you acquired and understanding of concepts rather than topics we covered and content knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  Our curriculum is organised in such away that you will become full-stack software developer and become an important resource to the team in which you are working.
</p>
<p>
  We have designed our curriculum such that we teach you all primary technologies you needed, so that you can learn specific technologies required by the product you want to develop easily.
