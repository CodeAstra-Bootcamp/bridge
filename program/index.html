<h1>Our Program</h1>
<h2 id="overview-intro" class="anchorable">Intro</h2>
<p>
  There is a huge gap between academia and industry. Our program bridges the gap with through our well designed Bridge program. Our Bridge program transforms beginners into confident software developers. Through effort, community support, and training, we help beginners with little or no technical background become confident software developers.
</p>
<p>
  Our 18-week curriculum  focuses on core computer subjects like Operating System, Database Management, Computer Networks, and Problem Solving by understanding algorithms and data structures to implement algorithms efficiently. We will also focus on  Ruby, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, common JavaScript libraries, SQL, HTML and CSS, as well as pair programming, agile methodology and test driven development which enables you to develop your own product or idea all by yourselves.
</p>

<h2 id="overview-whom-we-take" class="anchorable">Whom we take</h2>
<p>
  We believe anyone can join us. We do not base our admissions decision on past academic performance or programming experience of students as long as they are passionate to write code and are willing to work hard and learn new things. We look for students who have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ablility to think analytically and creatively about problems.</li>
  <li>Alignment with our values, which include willingness to learn new things and a passion for working with others.</li>
  <li>A desire to create meaningful and useful projects to the world through code.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We make it a point to have people from all academic backgrounds and performances. We consider people who are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>From Computer Science background and did exceptionally well in academics.</li>
  <li>From Computer Science background who did moderately well in acedemics.</li>
  <li>From Computer Science background who couldn't do well in acedemics.</li>
  <li>From non Computer Science background and did exceptionally well in academics.</li>
  <li>From non Computer Science background who did moderately well in acedemics.</li>
  <li>From non Computer Science background who couldn't do well in acedemics.</li>
  <li>College drop-outs, who believe there is other exciting stuff that can be done outside the college.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We make sure that an equal share of students from each of the above categories are included in each of our batches, to make sure that the acedemic diversity is preserved.
</p>

<h2 id="overview-how-we-learn" class="anchorable">How you learn</h2>
<p>
  <b>Eat, Sleep, Code</b> is our mantra. While you are with us, the only thing that you would be doing apart from eating and sleeping is coding. Infact, some of our past students have informed us that they even dream in code!
</p>
<p>
  Bridge program is something more than just teaching how to code. We show you how to make your ideas into reality and have fun while doing it!
</p>
<p>
  Our mentoring is on individual-to-individual basis not to a group of students. If you are very good in one area but need extra help in other, we will support according to your needs.
</p>
<p>
  Our emphasis is primarily on acquiring practical skills and understanding of concepts rather than topics we covere and mere content knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  We have designed our curriculum to equip you with the required technologies, so that you are ready to face the real battle.
