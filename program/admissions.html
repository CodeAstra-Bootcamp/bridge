<h1>Admissions</h1>
<h2 id="admissions-intro" class="anchorable">Intro</h2>
<p>
  Many of students misconceive that only students who have professional or education programming experience should apply. But our program is open to all who want to attend our program and complete it with high motivation. In fact, we make it a point to include people from all academic backgrounds and performances.
</p>
<p>
  We consider applicants from computer science background and non-computer science background alike in the admission process. We consider applicants whom did exceedingly well, moderately well, not so well in their past academics alike in the admission process. We would also like to encourage dropouts.
</p>
<p>
  Albert Einstein couldn't talk till he was four. He did not pass the college3 exam the first time he took it. Yet, he is the greatest scientist of all time! <br>
  David Karp dropped out of high school at 15, yet founded Tumblr to later sell it for $1.1 billion! <br>
  Abraham Lincoln, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs... The list is pretty long. <br>
  We believe that academic performance is not always a good index of potential. So, we encourage everyone to apply and we treat everyone the same during the selection process.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to attend our program, and you have the drive and motivation to get through it, then you can do it. Most of our students have no professional or educational programming experience. Many applicants are worried that they don’t have enough experience for program, or that they don’t fit the profile of the stereotypical developer. Don’t let these fears deter you from applying.
</p>
<p>
  Are we selective? Yes.
</p>
<p>
  Does this decrease your chance of being admitted? No.
</p>
<p>
  You determine whether you’ll be accepted to the program by conveying your level of commitment, internal motivations, and ability to think and communicate in your interview.
